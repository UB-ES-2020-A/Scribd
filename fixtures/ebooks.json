      "description": "Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware. But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardry possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwined with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment.",

      "description": "the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Right before the start of term, a supremely dangerous criminal breaks out of a supposedly impregnable wizards' prison; it will come as no surprise to Potter fans that the villain, a henchman of Harry's old enemy Lord Voldemort, appears to have targeted Harry. In many ways this installment seems to serve a transitional role in the seven-volume series: while many of the adventures are breathlessly relayed, they appear to be laying groundwork for even more exciting adventures to come. The beauty here lies in the genius of Rowling's plotting. Seemingly minor details established in books one and two unfold to take on unforeseen significance, and the finale, while not airtight in its internal logic, is utterly thrilling. Rowling's wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world (Just how would a magician be made to stay behind bars?) or tossing off quick jokes (a grandmother wears a hat decorated with a stuffed vulture; the divination classroom looks like a tawdry tea shop). The Potter spell is holding strong. All ages.",

Initially impressed by Dracula's gracious manners, Harker soon realizes that he is Dracula's prisoner. Wandering the Count's castle against Dracula's admonition, Harker encounters three vampire sisters, from whom he is rescued by Dracula. Harker soon realizes that Dracula himself is also a vampire. After the preparations are made, Dracula leaves Transylvania and abandons Harker to the sisters. Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life.",

Tras la Batalla de Awa, los sheks que sobrevivieron han huido a las monta�as para recuperarse del mazazo recibido (salvo el peque�o grupo encabezado por Ziessel, que cruz� la Puerta dimensional hacia La Tierra). Ashran el Nigromante ha muerto y la Torre de Drackwen ha quedado en ruinas. En la Torre de Kazlunn, el �ltimo unicornio agoniza. Despu�s de que su cuerno fuera extirpado, Victoria est� al borde de la muerte. Sin embargo, acaba recuper�ndose, y se va a la Tierra con Kirtash (tambi�n llamado Christian) para vivir en su �tico de Nueva York y protegerse de todos los peligros que los acechan; sin embargo Jack se queda en Idh�n para investigar una serie de extra�os sucesos que est�n teniendo lugar en el planeta: una serie de misteriosos terremotos han obligado a los gigantes a exiliarse de Nanhai, rumbo al sur; un tornado devasta la regi�n de Celestia; una ola gigante se estrella contra las costas del reino de Nanetten... No tardan en darse cuenta de que los dioses han llegado a Idh�n, y est�n arrasando todo a su paso. Su misi�n es buscar al S�ptimo, cuya esencia huy� del cuerpo de Ashran el Nigromante y ahora se aloja en el de la fe�rica Gerde.",
